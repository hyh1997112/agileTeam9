- Name: Jiabin Chen
- I am Jiabin Chen, a master student of Information Systems Management program, Global track. So I studied in Adelaide, Australia last academic year and I really enjoyed my life there! If possible, you should have a trip there and I believe you will fall in love with the sunshine and the sea. In my spare time, I love swimming (but I cannot recently) and reading novels, especially science fiction.
